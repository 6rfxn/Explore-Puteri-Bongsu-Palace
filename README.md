## How to Open the Game in Roblox

To open the game, you need to download **Roblox** on your device. Roblox has two components:

1. **Roblox Player** – where you play games  
2. **Roblox Studio** – where you create games

### Steps

1. Create a Roblox account (similar to creating one in Unity).  
2. Log in to **Roblox Studio**.  
3. After logging in, go to **File > Packages**.  
4. Open the file **`PalacePuteriBongsuPalace.rbxl`**.

### Notes
Some audio may not play due to differences in game ownership permissions.
